## 1(a). Explain the following architecture terms
### (i) Thin clients
It conducts a minimum processing on the client side.
Example, web browser.

### (ii) Fat clients
Fat clients carry more processing load. Used in traditional Client/Server model.
Example, desktop application, desktop game.

### (iii) Fat servers
Fat clients contain more application functionalities, provides more abstract, higher level functions. Client is often using a fast web browser.
Advantage: easier to manage, because when the system need to change, most of the change is done on the server side.

## 1(b) Explain the benefits of:
### (i) 2-tier client server model
- 2 tier usually means desktop application
- can be easily developed
- easy to maintain
- less complicated

### (ii) 3-tier architecture
- high scalable
- easier to distribute the application (e.g. via browser)
- application logic can be separted from UI logic
- higher overall  performance
- enhanced security
- platform independence
- higher data integrity (because app logic is separated from data-access logic)

## 1(c) Explain the value X and Y for the partition /dev/sdXY for both IDE and SCSI type disk.
